# Glot CLI Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Implementation for Rust

### Status Legend

- [ ] todo
- [x] done
- [üöß] in progress
- [üö´] blocked
- [‚è≠Ô∏è] skipped

### Current Tasks

- [x] Create TODO.md file in nix-polyglot repo for glot CLI implementation
- [x] Create .nix-polyglot/glot.bash implementation file
- [x] Update rust-nix sample with simple .envrc that sources glot.bash
- [x] Create install-hooks nix app for git hook management
- [x] Test basic glot commands in rust-nix sample
- [x] Verify git hooks work properly with new setup

## Phase 2: Enhanced Script Features ‚úÖ COMPLETED + EXCEEDED

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Add completion generation system to glot script
- [x] Implement `glot completion bash|zsh|fish` command
- [x] Add `glot install-completions` for automatic shell setup
- [x] Add `glot version` command showing glot and project versions
- [x] Add `glot upgrade-glot` command for updating glot implementation
- [x] Test completion system across bash/zsh shells
- [x] Add error handling and better user feedback

### MAJOR UPGRADES (Beyond Original Plan)

- [x] **Migrated from 580+ line bash script to ~200 line Go implementation**
- [x] **Central distribution via nix-polyglot packages**
- [x] **Smart caching with automatic version synchronization**
- [x] **Simplified CLI interface** (`--release` flag instead of `--variant debug|release`)
- [x] **Cross-platform binary with ~5ms execution time**
- [x] **Proper error handling with colored output**

## Phase 3: Extended Commands & Multi-Language Support

### Current Tasks

- [ ] Extend glot to python-nix sample
- [ ] Extend glot to csharp-nix sample
- [ ] Implement `glot new [template] [name]` with template discovery
- [ ] Add cross-compilation support (--platform)
- [ ] Add shell completion installation to project templates
- [ ] Create unified template system integration
- [ ] Documentation and user guides

### Completed from Original Phase 3

- [x] ~~Add variant support improvements~~ (Simplified to --release flag)

### Optional Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add `glot watch` command for continuous building
- [ ] Add `glot bench` command for performance testing
- [ ] Add `glot docs` command for documentation generation
- [ ] Integration with IDE/editor configurations

## Working with this TODO

**For continuing work:**

1. Read this TODO to understand current status
2. Use TodoWrite tool to update task progress as you work
3. Mark tasks as: `pending` ‚Üí `in_progress` ‚Üí `completed`
4. Add new tasks if you discover additional work needed
5. Focus on completing Phase 2 before moving to Phase 3

**Current Status:** Phase 1 & 2 COMPLETE! Go-based glot CLI fully operational with smart caching.

**Current Priority:** Extend glot support to other language samples (python-nix, csharp-nix).

**Implementation Location:**

- Central: `/Users/ritzau/src/slask/nix/polyglot/nix-polyglot/src/glot/main.go`
- Sample: `/Users/ritzau/src/slask/nix/polyglot/samples/rust-nix/.cache/bin/glot` (auto-cached)

## Implementation Details

### Current Implemented Commands ‚úÖ

```bash
# Core commands (all implemented)
glot build [target] [--release]           # Simplified interface
glot run [target] [--release] [-- args...]
glot fmt
glot lint
glot test
glot check
glot clean
glot update
glot info
glot shell
glot help [command]

# Enhanced features (all implemented)
glot completion bash|zsh|fish
glot install-completions
glot version
glot upgrade-glot         # Shows upgrade instructions
```

### Current Architecture ‚úÖ

```
# Central implementation
nix-polyglot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/glot/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go              # Go implementation (~200 lines)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ flake.nix                # Exposes packages.glot

# Project structure
rust-nix/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .envrc                   # Smart caching with timestamp check
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cache/bin/glot          # Auto-cached binary (ignored by git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore               # Excludes .cache/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ flake.nix                # References nix-polyglot.packages.glot
```

### Git Hooks Strategy

- Pre-commit: `glot fmt` (fast)
- Pre-push: `glot check` (comprehensive, bypassable)

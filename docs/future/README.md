# Future Directions

This directory contains detailed specifications for potential future enhancements to the glot CLI and nix-polyglot system.

## Overview

Each document represents a well-thought-out enhancement that could significantly expand glot's capabilities. These are not immediate roadmap items, but rather comprehensive designs ready for implementation when priorities and resources align.

## Current Proposals

### 1. [Cross-Compilation Support](01-cross-compilation.md)

**Status**: Design Complete  
**Complexity**: 3/10 (Simple)  
**Impact**: Medium

Add `--target` flag to enable cross-compilation for different architectures and platforms.

**Key Features:**

- Zero breaking changes to existing workflow
- Leverages nix's robust cross-compilation infrastructure
- Single glot binary approach with target-specific builds
- Support for major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)

**Example Usage:**

```bash
glot build --target=aarch64-linux    # Cross-compile for ARM64 Linux
glot run --target=x86_64-darwin      # Run with emulation
```

### 2. [Language Extension System](02-language-extensions.md)

**Status**: Design Complete  
**Complexity**: 6/10 (Moderate)  
**Impact**: High

Enable third-party language extensions to expand glot beyond built-in languages.

**Key Features:**

- Plugin architecture for community-contributed languages
- Extension registry and discovery system
- Consistent glot interface across all languages
- Independent development and maintenance by language communities

**Example Usage:**

```bash
glot extensions add golang-community/go
glot new go my-web-server
glot build  # Uses Go extension seamlessly
```

## Design Principles

All future enhancements follow these core principles:

### 1. **Backward Compatibility**

- No breaking changes to existing commands or workflows
- Existing projects continue working unchanged
- New features are purely additive

### 2. **Consistent Interface**

- Same `glot` commands work across all enhancements
- Familiar patterns and behaviors
- Minimal learning curve for users

### 3. **Nix Integration**

- Leverage nix's strengths (reproducibility, caching, declarative config)
- Follow nix ecosystem patterns and conventions
- Maintain performance and reliability characteristics

### 4. **Community Enablement**

- Enable community contributions and extensions
- Provide clear interfaces and documentation
- Support diverse use cases and workflows

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority

- **Language Extensions**: Enables ecosystem growth and community contributions
- Unlocks support for many more programming languages
- Reduces maintenance burden on core team

### Medium Priority

- **Cross-Compilation**: Important for deployment and distribution scenarios
- Relatively simple to implement with existing nix infrastructure
- Clear user demand and use cases

### Future Considerations

Additional enhancements that could be explored:

- **Watch Mode**: Continuous building and testing (`glot watch`)
- **Container Integration**: First-class Docker/OCI support
- **Cloud Deployment**: Direct deployment to cloud platforms
- **Performance Profiling**: Built-in benchmarking and profiling
- **Plugin System**: Beyond language extensions (tools, workflows)

## Evaluation Criteria

When prioritizing future enhancements, consider:

### Technical Criteria

- **Complexity**: Implementation difficulty and maintenance burden
- **Risk**: Potential for breaking changes or system instability
- **Dependencies**: External dependencies and ecosystem requirements

### User Value Criteria

- **Impact**: How many users benefit and how significantly
- **Demand**: Community requests and demonstrated need
- **Adoption**: Likelihood of actual usage vs. theoretical value

### Strategic Criteria

- **Ecosystem**: Contribution to nix-polyglot ecosystem growth
- **Differentiation**: Unique value vs. existing solutions
- **Sustainability**: Long-term maintenance and evolution path

## Contributing to Future Directions

### Adding New Proposals

To propose a new future direction:

1. **Research existing solutions** and identify gaps
2. **Create detailed specification** following existing format
3. **Include implementation phases** with time estimates
4. **Consider backward compatibility** and migration strategy
5. **Submit PR** with comprehensive documentation
